Taking into consideration the given Inefficiencies in current MVP, there can be following future improvements:

-> Adding more images to corpus will build a more reliable search engine for images.
-> Instead of current Indexing technique of building Inverted Index, 
we can use techniques like Single-Pass In-Memory Indexing (SPIMI) to efficiently build Inverted Index
for our search engine as compared to current process. Even more efficient way to built the Inverted 
Index is "Distributed Indexing" using MapReduce.
-> Current MVP interface can be reconstructed to a GUI(Graphical User Interface) rather than a command-line interface
in order to display images as compared to just giving image URLs as result.
-> This MVP project can be structured into modules where each module has a specific task, 
e.g. one module builds Inverted Index, some other module handles HTTP requests, 
another module handles search for images etc.
-> API key, Clarifai Predict General ModelID, API domain and endpoints can be saved in some environment variable 
rather than hard-coding them.
-> The number of concepts returned per image can be configured by changing the API call data with addition of MaxConcepts fields.
-> The minimum prediction threshold for each concept can also be configured by changing the API call data.
-> The current MVP can be dockerized to enforce continuous deployment and testing.
