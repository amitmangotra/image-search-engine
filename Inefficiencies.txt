The following are some inefficiences with this Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

-> The image corpus is small. There are only 1000 image URLs to build the 
Inverted Index. This makes the search less reliable, e.g. for some terms/keywords there is no image.
-> Currently, building Inverted Index for images is a slow process where 1000 image URLs 
are predicted for concepts one by one, thereby taking 9-10 minutes for search engine to be ready.
-> The current MVP is a command line interface, reading input from stdin and displaying image URLs.
-> The MVP project is structured in a single file `main.go` to make HTTP requests, build Inverted Index
and perform search for images.
-> The API key, Clarifai Predict General ModelID, `images.txt` file, API Domain and endpoint are currently hard-coded.
-> The current MVP predicts 20 concepts per image as default.
